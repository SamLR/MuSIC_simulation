# Create a scene handler/viewer for a specific graphics system
#    The compound command "/vis/open <vis-driver-name>"
#    is equivalent to the following set of commands:
#
#    /vis/sceneHandler/create
#    /vis/viewer/create
#
# Create a scene handler and a viewer for the OGLIX driver
#here!
/vis/open OGLIX
#
#here!
#/vis/viewer/set/style wireframe
# Set direction from target to camera.

#
#    The compound command "/vis/drawVolume"
#    is equivalent to the following set of commands:
#
#    /vis/scene/create
#    /vis/scene/add/volume
#    /vis/sceneHandler/attach
# Create an empty scene and add the detector geometry to it
#here!
/vis/drawVolume
#
# Store particle trajectories for visualization
# (if too many tracks cause core dump => storeTrajectory 0)
#here!
/tracking/storeTrajectory 1
#
# Add trajectories to the current scene
# Note: This command is not necessary since the C++ method DrawTrajectory()
#       is called in scintEventAction::EndOfEventAction
#here!
/vis/scene/add/trajectories
#
# Requests viewer to accumulate hits, tracks, etc. at end of event. 
# detector remains or is redrawn.
